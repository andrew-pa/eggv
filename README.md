# eggv
A flexible Vulkan based rendering engine that is designed to support many different rendering algorithms.
Eggv also attempts provides a runtime user interface to all interesting system parameters so you can tweak visuals at runtime.
It is also scriptable using a custom built Lisp runtime ([emlisp](https://github.com/andrew-pa/emlisp)) that uses automatically generated bindings to interact with the C++ engine.
